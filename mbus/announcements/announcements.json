I'm the developer, Jonah Grant (@jonahgrant), and I'm a prospective freshman at UofM.\n\nI built this app after visiting campus and becoming fixated on the tech atmosphere in Ann Arbor.  After initially being deferred I was waitlisted.  I'm hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. But if you use MBus and appreciate what I've built, it would mean a lot to me if you could tap this and send a short message to the admissions department about how MBus has been helpful. Thanks everyone!",
