After initially being deferred I was waitlisted. I'm cautiosly optomistic, but expecting to be denied. But if you use MBus and appreciate what I've built, it would mean a lot to me if you could tap this and send a short message to the admissions department about how MBus has been helpful in your time at UMich. Thank you everyone!",
